# Go project structure

- Go programmers typically keep all their Go code in a single workspace.
- A workspace contains many version control repositories (managed by Git, - for example).
- Each repository contains one or more packages.
- Each package consists of one or more Go source files in a single directory.
- The path to a package's directory determines its import path.
